        <h2>Emoticons</h2>

        <p>Emoticons are textual portrayals of a writer's moods or facial<br>
        expressions in the form of icons. Originally, these icons<br>
        consisted of ASCII art.</p>

        <p></p>Emoticons can generally be divided into two groups: Western (mainly<br>
        from America and Europe) or horizontal; Eastern or vertical (mainly<br>
        from east Asia).</p>
        
        <h2>Western</h2>
        
        <p>Western style emoticons are mostly written from left to right as<br>
        though the head is rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees.</p>
        
        <p>Smiley: :‑) :-&gt;<br>
        Tongue-tied: :‑&amp;<br>
        Broken heart: &lt;\3<br>
        Rose: @}-&gt;--<br>
        Fish: &gt;&lt;(((*&gt;</p>
        
        <h2>Eastern</h2>
        
        <p>Eastern emoticons generally are not rotated sideways. They first<br>
        arose in Japan, where they are referred to as kaomoji.</p>
        
        <p>Troubled: (&lt;_&gt;)
        Sad: ("_")<br>
        Cat: (=^·^=)<br>
        Headphones: ((d[-_-]b))</p>
